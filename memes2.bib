	isbn = {978-1-61729-329-0},
	abstract = {"Developers want to get work done - and the less hassle, the better. Coding with Kotlin means less hassle. The Kotlin programming language offers an expressive syntax, a strong intuitive type system, and great tooling support along with seamless interoperability with existing Java code, libraries, and frameworks. Kotlin can be compiled to Java bytecode, so you can use it everywhere Java is used, including Android. And with an efficient compiler and a small standard library, Kotlin imposes virtually no runtime overhead. Kotlin in Action teaches you to use the Kotlin language for production-quality applications. Written for experienced Java developers, this example-rich book goes further than most language books, covering interesting topics like building {DSLs} with natural language syntax. The authors are core Kotlin developers, so you can trust that even the gnarly details are dead accurate. What's inside: Functional programming on the {JVM}; writing clean and idiomatic code; combining Kotlin and Java; domain-specific languages. This book is for experienced Java developers'--Back cover},

	abstract = {Despite the undisputed prominence of inheritance as the fundamental reuse mechanism in object-oriented programming languages, the main variants—single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and mixin inheritance—all suffer from conceptual and practical problems. In the first part of this paper, we identify and illustrate these problems. We then present traits, a simple compositional model for structuring object-oriented programs. A trait is essentially a group of pure methods that serves as a building block for classes and is a primitive unit of code reuse. In this model, classes are composed from a set of traits by specifying glue code that connects the traits together and accesses the necessary state. We demonstrate how traits overcome the problems arising from the different variants of inheritance, we discuss how traits can be implemented effectively, and we summarize our experience applying traits to refactor an existing class hierarchy.},
